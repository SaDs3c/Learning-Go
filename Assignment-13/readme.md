# Assignment 13
Create a program that prompts the user to input scoring totals for 5 players during 4 basketball games. the program will track which player had the highest scoring average over the 4 games and print the result to the terminal.

Hint: Use a two-dimensional array and nested for loops. the output-most for loop will iterate on a per game basis gathering scores for the inner-most for loop interating through players. Use this same model to create arrays to store total scores and to calculate averages.

Extra Credit: There is none. this one is pretty hard!
