# Assignment 7
Prompt the user for A, B, and C values and then use those values to determine the value of 'X' using the <a href="https://en.m.wikipidia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula"> quadratic formula</a>

if you need to brush up on the quadratic formula, hit up <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iulx0z1lz8M"> Khan Academy! </a>

Hint: Make your life easier by including the math package

Extra Credit: Build in a mechanism which checks the solution by plugging it back into the formula and seeing if it equals 0. Use if control flow to instruct the user to double checks all solutions which aren't confirmed(a lot won't be confirmed) since they'll be truncated decimals). 

# Example Output
ftsog@nigeria:~/LearningGo/Assignment-07$ ./assignment7
Enter the value of a variable 'A': -7
Enter the value of a variable 'B': 2
Enter the value of a variable 'C': 9
The solution using the '+' operator is: -1.00
the solution using the '-' operator is: 1.29, but you might want to double-check that...
