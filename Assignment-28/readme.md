# Assignment 28
By now you can do a lot with Go, But there is still a lot to learn, we barely even scratched the surface of Go. We didn't even discuss data typing much, cucurrency etc.

using the actuall system call this time.
your assignment is to read about the "syscall" package and using the package to create a simple program that read the content in the sadsec.txt file.

There is no limit except how much research you want to do and your imagination.

from the sadsec team
Congratulations you made it to the end!
